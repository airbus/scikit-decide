- MCTS:
   - spdlog's default logger is multi-threaded so remove unnecessary debug logs protections
   - add custom mutexes for time reporting and random generator calls
   - add node garbage on action progression

- RIW:
   - spdlog's default logger is multi-threaded so remove unnecessary debug logs protections
   - add custom mutexes for time reporting and random generator calls

- A* and AO*:
   - _goal_checker called only once zhen expanding the state

- AO*:
   - catch exception of python solver's get_next_action() and get_utility()

- LRTDP and LAO*:
   - check SSP?

- examples:
   - check order of domain and state in all C++-based solver lambdas
   - add all compatible algorithms to grid_multisolve (for instance A* is missing)
   - add domain factory argument in C++-based solvers in all examples
