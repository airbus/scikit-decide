## Introduction

Scikit-decide is an AI framework for Reinforcement Learning, Automated Planning and Scheduling.

It is meant for being a one-stop shop solution to formalize decision-making problems, finding compatible solvers among a growing catalog and get the best solution possible. The catalog is a combination of wrapped existing domains/solvers and newly contributed ones.

### As a domain developer

::: tip
Scikit-decide supports formalizing the problem one characteristic at a time without the need of being an algorithmic expert nor knowing in advance the best kind of solver for this task (RL, planning, scheduling or any hybrid type).
:::

### As a solver developer

::: tip
Scikit-decide provides a meaningful API to interact with domains at the expected level of information, as well as a catalog of domains/solvers to test/benchmark new algorithms.

## Installation

### 1. Make sure to have a Python 3.7+ environment

The use of a virtual environment for scikit-decide is recommended, e.g. by using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install):

    conda create --name skdecide python=3.7
    conda activate skdecide

### 2. Install the scikit-decide library

#### a. Full installation (recommended)

Make sure you are in the "scikit-decide for Python" root directory and install with Pip:

    cd YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_GIT_CLONED_SKDECIDE/python
    pip install .[all]

This will install the core library and additionally all dependencies required by domains/solvers in the hub (scikit-decide catalog).

Alternatively, if you wish to install only the ones required by domains (resp. solvers) from the hub, replace `[all]` in the last command by `[domains]` (resp. `[solvers]`).

#### b. Minimal installation (not recommended)

Make sure you are in the "scikit-decide for Python" root directory and install with Pip:

    cd YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_GIT_CLONED_SKDECIDE/python
    pip install .

This will only install the core library, which is enough if you intend to create your own domain and solver.

## Getting started

Domain characteristics are one of the key concepts in scikit-decide: they are combined on the one hand to define domains, on the other hand to specify the envelope of domains a solver can tackle.

Each characteristic has various levels, from general (high-level) to specialized (low-level) ones, each level inheriting higher-level functions. Any domain fully contained in a solver's envelope is compatible with this solver, unless it violates additional requirements (optional).

Defining a domain to solve is a matter of:
- selecting a base domain class (`Domain` by default or any pre-made template for typical combinations like `DeterministicPlanningDomain`)
- fine-tuning any necessary characteristic level with something more specialized (lower-level)
- auto-generating the code skeleton from the combination above (technically by implementing all abstract methods)
- filling the code as needed based on domain expertise

::: tip
When starting a new domain or solver, it is highly recommended to check the [code generators](#code-generators) for assistance and auto-generation of the skeleton to fill.
:::

Check [How to](#how-to) to see how to find compatible solvers and compute a solution, once a domain is defined.

## How to

::: warning
Exact prints and outputs may vary depending on which domains/solvers are registered on your system.
:::

### Select a domain to solve

This step can be skipped if a domain has already been defined. Otherwise, here is how to load one from the catalog of registered domains:

```python
from skdecide import utils

print(utils.get_registered_domains())
# prints: ['GymDomain', 'MasterMind', 'Maze', 'RockPaperScissors', ...]

MyDomain = utils.load_registered_domain('Maze')
```

### Find compatible solvers

This step can be skipped if a solver is already known to be compatible and selected as best candidate. Otherwise, here is how to find all compatible solvers:

```python
compatible_solvers = utils.match_solvers(MyDomain())
print(compatible_solvers)
# prints: [<class 'skdecide.hub.solver.lazy_astar.lazy_astar.LazyAstar'>, ...]

MySolver = compatible_solvers[0]  # selecting Lazy A* solver here
```

### Compute a solution

Here is how to solve `MyDomain` with `MySolver`:

```python
# Simple case (no arguments for domain nor solver)
solution = MyDomain.solve_with(MySolver)

# Case with solver arguments
solution = MyDomain.solve_with(lambda: MySolver(verbose=True))
```

### Test the solution

```python
# Simple case (one basic rollout)
utils.rollout(MyDomain(), solution)

# Example of additional rollout parameters
utils.rollout(MyDomain(), solution, num_episodes=3, max_steps=1000, max_framerate=30)
```

In the example of the Maze solved with Lazy A*, the goal (in green) should be reached by the agent (in blue):

## Examples

**Go to <router-link to="_examples">Examples</router-link> for a curated list of Python notebooks (recommended to start).**

More examples can be found in the `/examples` folder, showing how to import or define a domain, and how to run or solve it. Most of the examples rely on scikit-decide Hub, an extensible catalog of domains/solvers.

**Warning**: the examples whose filename starts with an underscore are currently being migrated to the new API and might not be working in the meantime (same goes for domains/solvers inside `skdecide/hub`).

**Warning**: some content currently in the hub (especially the MasterMind domain and the POMCP/CGP solvers) will require permission from their original authors before entering the public hub when open sourced.

### Playground

The best example to try out scikit-decide capabilities might be `examples/full_multisolve.py`. This interactive console experience makes it easy to pick a domain among a pre-defined catalog selection:

- Simple Grid World
- Maze
- Mastermind
- Cart Pole (OpenAI Gym)
- Mountain Car continuous (OpenAI Gym)
- ATARI Pacman (OpenAI Gym)

...and then solve it with any compatible solver (detected automatically) among following selection:

- Random walk
- Simple greedy
- Lazy A* (classical planning)
- PPO: Proximal Policy Optimization (deep reinforcement learning)
- POMCP: Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (online planning for POMDP)
- CGP: Cartesian Genetic Programming (evolution strategy)
- IW: Iterated Width search (width-based planning)

**Note**: some requirements declared in above solvers still need fine-tuning, so in some cases an auto-detected compatible solver may still be unable to solve a domain (for now).

These combinations are particularly efficient if you want to try them out:

- Simple Grid World -> Lazy A*
- Maze -> Lazy A*
- Mastermind -> POMCP: Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning
- Cart Pole -> PPO: Proximal Policy Optimization
- Mountain Car continuous -> CGP: Cartesian Genetic Programming
- ATARI Pacman -> Random walk

**Warning**: some domains/solvers might require extra manual setup steps to work at 100%. In the future, each scikit-decide hub entry should have a dedicated help page to list them, but in the meantime please refer to this:

- [domain] OpenAI Gym ones -> [gym](http://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation) for loading Gym environments not included by default
- [solver] PPO: Proximal Policy Optimization -> see [Stable Baselines installation](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html)
- [solver] IW: Iterated Width search (same for AOstar, Astar, BFWS) -> special C++ compilation (TBD)

## Roadmap
