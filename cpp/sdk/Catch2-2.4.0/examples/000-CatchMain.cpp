// 000-CatchMain.cpp

// In a Catch project with multiple files, dedicate one file to compile the
// source code of Catch itself and reuse the resulting object file for linking.

// Let Catch provide main():
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN

#include <catch2/catch.hpp>

// That's it

// Compile implementation of Catch for use with files that do contain tests:
// - g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -I$(CATCH_SINGLE_INCLUDE) -c 000-CatchMain.cpp
// - cl -EHsc -I%CATCH_SINGLE_INCLUDE% -c 000-CatchMain.cpp
