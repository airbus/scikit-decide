== About C-Convey

The convey framework in this directory was originally started for
this project, but has since been promoted to a project of it's own.
Please see it's home page on https://github.com/gdamore/c-convey[github]
for updates and further information.

The convey framework is licensed under the same terms as the rest
of this project (MIT style license).

Having said that, we are moving towards a new testing infrastructure.
See the acutest.h header in this directory, along with testutil.h.

Please do not write new tests in c-convey format.
