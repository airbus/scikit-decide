== NAME

nng_mtx_alloc - allocate mutex

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/util/platform.h>

typedef struct nng_mtx nng_mtx;

int nng_mtx_alloc(nng_mtx **mtxp);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_mtx_alloc()` function allocates mutex and returns it in _mtxp_.

The mutex objects created by this function are suitable only for
simple lock and unlock operations, and are not recursive.
Every effort has been made to use light-weight underlying primitives when available.

Mutex (mutual exclusion) objects can be thought of as binary semaphores,
where only a single thread of execution is permitted to "`own`" the semaphore.

Furthermore, a mutex can only be unlocked by the thread that locked it.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient free memory exists.
