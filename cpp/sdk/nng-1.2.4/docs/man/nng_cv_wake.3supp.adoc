== NAME

nng_cv_wake - wake all waiters

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/util/platform.h>

void nng_cv_wake(nng_cv *cv);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_cv_wake()` wakes any threads waiting for the condition variable _cv_
to be signaled in the xref:nng_cv_wait.3supp.adoc[`nng_cv_wait()`] or
xref:nng_cv_until.3supp.adoc[`nng_cv_until()`] functions.

The caller must have have ownership of the mutex that was used when
_cv_ was allocated.

NOTE: The caller should already have set the condition that the waiters
will check, while holding the mutex.

TIP: This function wakes all threads, which is generally safer but can
lead to a problem known as the "`thundering herd`" when there are many
waiters, as they are all woken simultaneously.
See xref:nng_cv_wake1.3supp.adoc[`nng_cv_wake1()`] for a solution to this problem.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

None.
