== NAME

nng_pair - pair protocol

== SYNOPSIS

.Version 0
[source,c]
----
#include <nng/protocol/pair0/pair.h>
----

.Version 1
[source,c]
----
#include <nng/protocol/pair1/pair.h>
----

== DESCRIPTION

(((protocol, _pair_)))
The ((_pair_ protocol)) implements a peer-to-peer pattern, where
relationships between peers are one-to-one.

Version 1 of this protocol supports an optional ((_polyamorous_ mode)) where a
peer can maintain multiple partnerships.
Using this mode requires some additional sophistication in the application.

=== Socket Operations

The xref:nng_pair_open.3.adoc[`nng_pair_open()`] functions create a _pair_ socket.

Normally, this pattern will block when attempting to send a message if
no peer is able to receive the message.

NOTE: Even though this mode may appear to be "reliable", because back-pressure
prevents discarding messages most of the time, there are topologies involving
_devices_ (see xref:nng_device.3.adoc[`nng_device()`]) or raw mode sockets
(see xref:nng_options.5.adoc#NNG_OPT_RAW[`NNG_OPT_RAW`]) where
messages may be discarded.
Applications that require reliable delivery semantics should consider using
xref:nng_req.7.adoc[_req_] sockets, or
implement their own acknowledgment layer on top of _pair_ sockets.

In order to avoid head-of-line blocking conditions, _polyamorous_ mode _pair_
sockets (version 1 only) discard messages if they are unable to deliver them
to a peer.

=== Protocol Versions

Version 0 is the legacy version of this protocol.
It lacks any header
information, and is suitable when building simple one-to-one topologies.

TIP: Use version 0 if you need to communicate with other implementations,
including the legacy https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg[nanomsg] library or
https://github.com/go-mangos/mangos[mangos].

Version 1 of the protocol offers improved protection against loops when
used with xref:nng_device.3.adoc[`nng_device()`].
It also offers _polyamorous_ mode for forming multiple partnerships
on a single socket.

NOTE: Version 1 of this protocol is considered experimental at this time.

=== Polyamorous Mode

Normally pair sockets are for one-to-one communication, and a given peer
will reject new connections if it already has an active connection to another
peer.

In ((_polyamorous_ mode)), which is only available with version 1, a socket can
support many one-to-one connections.
In this mode, the application must
choose the remote peer to receive an outgoing message by setting the
xref:nng_pipe.5.adoc[`nng_pipe`] to use for the outgoing message with
the xref:nng_msg_set_pipe.3.adoc[`nng_msg_set_pipe()`] function.

Most often the value of the outgoing pipe will be obtained from an incoming
message using the xref:nng_msg_get_pipe.3.adoc[`nng_msg_get_pipe()`] function,
such as when replying to an incoming message.

In order to prevent head-of-line blocking, if the peer on the given pipe
is not able to receive (or the pipe is no longer available, such as if the
peer has disconnected), then the message will be discarded with no notification
to the sender.

=== Protocol Options

The following protocol-specific options are available.

((`NNG_OPT_PAIR1_POLY`))::

   (`bool`, version 1 only)  This option enables the use of _polyamorous_ mode.
   The value is read-write, and takes an integer Boolean value.  The default
   false value (0) indicates that legacy monogamous mode should be used.

xref:nng_options.5.adoc#NNG_OPT_MAXTTL[`NNG_OPT_MAXTTL`]::

   (`int`, version 1 only).  Maximum time-to-live.

=== Protocol Headers

Version 0 of the pair protocol has no protocol-specific headers.

Version 1 of the pair protocol uses a single 32-bit unsigned value.  The
low-order (big-endian) byte of this value contains a "hop" count, and is
used in conjunction with the
xref:nng_options.5.adoc#NNG_OPT_MAXTTL[`NNG_OPT_MAXTTL`] option to guard against
device forwarding loops.
This value is initialized to 1, and incremented each time the message is
received by a new node.
