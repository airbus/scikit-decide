== NAME

nng_http_conn_write_all - write all to HTTP connection

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/http/http.h>

void nng_http_conn_write_all(nng_http_conn *conn, nng_aio *aio);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_http_conn_write_all()` function starts an asynchronous write to the
HTTP connection _conn_, into the scatter/gather vector located in the
asynchronous I/O structure _aio_.

NOTE: The xref:nng_aio_set_iov.3.adoc[`nng_aio_set_iov()`] function must have been
called first, to set the scatter/gather vector for _aio_.

This function returns immediately, with no return value.
Completion of the operation is signaled via the _aio_, and the
final result may be obtained via xref:nng_aio_result.3.adoc[`nng_aio_result()`].
That result will either be zero or an error code.

The I/O operation completes only when the entire amount of data
requested has been written, or an error has occurred.
If the operation completes successfully, then the entire requested data has
been written.

It is still possible for a partial write to complete in the event of an error.
The actual number of bytes written can be determined with
xref:nng_aio_count.3.adoc[`nng_aio_count()`].

TIP: The main purpose for this function is to facilitate writing HTTP
body content.

TIP: Usually an HTTP request or response will have been written immediately
prior to this with xref:nng_http_conn_write_req.3http.adoc[`http_conn_write_req()`] or
xref:nng_http_conn_write_res.3http.adoc[`http_conn_write_res()`].
In that case the request or response should have also contained
an `Content-Length` header, and possibly a `Content-Type` header.

TIP: An easier solution to sending HTTP content data, is to include the
content with the request or reply using a function like
xref:nng_http_req_copy_data.3http.adoc[`nng_http_req_copy_data()`].
In that case, the body data will be written automatically by the
xref:nng_http_conn_write_req.3http.adoc[`http_conn_write_req()`] or
xref:nng_http_conn_write_req.3http.adoc[`http_conn_write_res()`] function.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`NNG_ECANCELED`:: The operation was canceled.
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The connection was closed.
`NNG_ECONNRESET`:: The peer closed the connection.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: The _aio_ does not contain a valid scatter/gather vector.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient free memory to perform the operation.
`NNG_ENOTSUP`:: HTTP operations are not supported.
`NNG_ETIMEDOUT`:: Timeout waiting for data from the connection.
