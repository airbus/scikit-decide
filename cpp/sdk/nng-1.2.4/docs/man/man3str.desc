This section documents supplemental byte stream functions that
are available.

These functions are made available to facilitate using raw byte stream
connections with the NNG asynchronous I/O API.
These byte streams may be useful for applications that need to
communicate with raw TCP/IP or IPC streams instead of Scalability Protocols.
