== NAME

nn_connect - connect to remote peer (compatible API)

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nanomsg/nn.h>

int nn_connect(int sock, const char *url)
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nn_connect()` function arranges for the socket _sock_ to
initiate connection to a peer at the address specified by _url_.
An "`endpoint identifier`" for this socket's association with the _url_ is
returned to the caller on success.
This ID can be used with xref:nn_shutdown.3compat.adoc[`nn_shutdown()`] to
"`unbind`" the socket from the address at _url_.

NOTE: This function is provided for API
xref:nng_compat.3compat.adoc[compatibility] with legacy _libnanomsg_.
Consider using the relevant xref:libnng.3.adoc[modern API] instead.

NOTE: The connect operation is performed asynchronously, and may not have
completed before this function returns control to the caller.

IMPORTANT: Only transports supported by legacy _libnanomsg_ may be
used with this function.
In particular, only the schemes `tcp://`, `ipc://`, `inproc://`, and `ws://` are
supported with this function.
(Use the xref:libnng.3.adoc[modern API] to use other schemes.)

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns a positive identifier success, and -1 on error.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`ECONNREFUSED`:: The connection attempt was refused.
`EBADF`:: The socket _sock_ is not open.
`EINVAL`:: An invalid _url_ was supplied.
