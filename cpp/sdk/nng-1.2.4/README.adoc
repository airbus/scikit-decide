NOTE: If you are looking for the legacy version of nanomsg, please
see the https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg[nanomsg] repository.

This project is a rewrite of the Scalability Protocols
library known as https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg[libnanomsg],
and adds significant new capabilities, while retaining
compatibility with the original.

It may help to think of this as "nanomsg-next-generation".

== NNG: Lightweight Messaging Library

NNG, like its predecessors http://nanomsg.org[nanomsg] (and to some extent
http://zeromq.org/[ZeroMQ]), is a lightweight, broker-less library,
offering a simple API to solve common recurring messaging problems,
such as publish/subscribe, RPC-style request/reply, or service discovery.
The API frees the programmer from worrying about details like connection
management, retries, and other common considerations, so that they
can focus on the application instead of the plumbing.

NNG is implemented in C, requiring only C99 and CMake to build.
It can be built as a shared or a static library, and is readily
embeddable.  It is also designed to be easy to port to new platforms
if your platform is not already supported.

== License

NNG is licensed under a liberal, and commercial friendly, MIT license.
The goal to the license is to minimize friction in adoption, use, and
contribution.

== Enhancements (Relative to nanomsg)

Here are areas where this project improves on "nanomsg":

[horizontal]
*Reliability*:: NNG is designed for production use from the beginning.  Every
error case is considered, and it is designed to avoid crashing except in cases
of gross developer error.  (Hopefully we don't have any of these in our own
code.)

*Scalability*:: NNG scales out to engage multiple cores using a bespoke
asynchronous I/O framework, using thread pools to spread load without
exceeding typical system limits.

*Maintainability*:: NNG's architecture is designed to be modular and
easily grasped by developers unfamiliar with the code base.  The code
is also well documented.

*Extensibility*:: Because it avoids ties to file descriptors, and avoids
confusing interlocking state machines, it is easier to add new protocols
and transports to NNG.  This was demonstrated by the addition of the
TLS and ZeroTier transports.

*Security*:: NNG provides TLS 1.2 and ZeroTier transports, offering
support for robust and industry standard authentication and encryption.
In addition, it is hardened to be resilient against malicious attackers,
with special consideration given to use in a hostile Internet.

*Usability*:: NNG eschews slavish adherence parts of the more complex and
less well understood POSIX APIs, while adopting the semantics that are
familiar and useful.  New APIs are intuitive, and the optional support
for separating protocol context and state from sockets makes creating
concurrent applications vastly simpler than previously possible.

== Compatibility

This project offers both wire compatibility and API compatibility,
so most nanomsg users can begin using NNG right away.

Existing nanomsg and github.com/go-mangos/mangos[mangos] applications
can interoperate with NNG applications automatically.

That said, there are some areas where legacy nanomsg still offers
capabilities NNG lacks -- specifically enhanced observability with
statistics, and tunable prioritization of different destinations
are missing, but will be added in a future release.

Additionally, some API capabilities that are useful for foreign
language bindings are not implemented yet.

Some simple single threaded, synchronous applications may perform better under
legacy nanomsg than under NNG.  (We believe that these applications are the
least commonly deployed, and least interesting from a performance perspective.
NNG's internal design is slightly less efficient in such scenarios, but it
greatly benefits when concurrency or when multiple sockets or network peers
are involved.)

== Supported Platforms

NNG supports Linux, macOS, Windows (Vista or better), illumos, Solaris,
FreeBSD, Android, and iOS.  Most other POSIX platforms should work out of
the box but have not been tested.  Very old versions of otherwise supported
platforms might not work.

== Requirements

To build this project, you will need a C99 compatible compiler and
http://www.cmake.org[CMake] version 3.1 or newer.

We recommend using the https://ninja-build.org[Ninja] build
system (pass "-G Ninja" to CMake) when you can.
(And not just because Ninja sounds like "NNG" -- it's also
blindingly fast and has made our lives as developers measurably better.)

If you want to build with TLS support you will also need
https://tls.mbed.org[mbedTLS].  See <<docs/BUILD_TLS.adoc#>> for details.

== Quick Start

With a Linux or UNIX environment:

[source,sh]
----
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -G Ninja ..
  $ ninja
  $ ninja test
  $ ninja install
----

== API Documentation

The API documentation is provided in Asciidoc format in the
`docs/man` subdirectory, and also
https://nanomsg.github.io/nng[online].
The <<docs/man/libnng.3.adoc#,libnng(3)>> page is a good starting point.

You can also purchase a copy of the 
http://staysail.tech/books/nng_reference/index.html[__NNG Reference Manual__].
(It is published in both electronic and printed formats.)
Purchases of the book help fund continued development of NNG.

== Example Programs

Some demonstration programs have been created to help serve as examples.
These are located in the `demo` directory.

== Legacy Compatibility

A legacy libnanomsg compatible API is available, and while it offers
less capability than the modern NNG API, it may serve as a transition aid.
Please see <<docs/man/nng_compat.3compat.adoc#,nng_compat(3)>> for details.

== Commercial Support

Commercial support for NNG is available.

Please contact mailto:info@staysail.tech[Staysail Systems, Inc.] to
inquire further.

== Commercial Sponsors

The development of NNG has been made possible through the generous
sponsorship of https://www.capitar.com[Capitar IT Group BV] and
http://staysail.tech[Staysail Systems, Inc.].
