    "#  Gym environment with scikit-decide tutorial: Continuous Mountain Car\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will solve the continuous mountain car problem taken from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), a toolkit for developing environments, usually to be solved by reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
    "Continuous Mountain Car, a standard testing domain in Reinforcement Learning (RL), is a problem in which an under-powered car must drive up a steep hill. Note that we use here the *continuous* version of the mountain car because \n",
    "it has a shaped or dense reward (i.e. not sparse) which can be used successfully when solving, as opposed to the other \"Mountain Car\" environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reminder, a sparse reward is a reward which is null almost everywhere, whereas a dense or shaped reward has more meaningful values for most transitions.\n",

    "This problem has been chosen for three reasons:\n",
    "  - Show how scikit-decide can be used to solve Gym environments (the de-facto standard in the RL community),\n",
    "  - Highlight that by doing so, you will be able to use not only solvers from the RL community (like the ones in [stable_baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) for example), but also other solvers coming from other communities like genetic programming and planning/search (use of an underlying search graph) that can be very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in this notebook we will go through the following steps:\n",
    "  - Wrap a Gym environment in a scikit-decide domain;\n",
    "  - Use a classical RL algorithm like PPO to solve our problem;\n",
    "  - Give CGP (Cartesian Genetic Programming)  a try on the same problem;\n",
    "  - Finally use IW (Iterated Width) coming from the planning community on the same problem."
