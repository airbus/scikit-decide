    "RL is particularly suited for stochastic domains, ```StochasticRCPSPSGSDomain``` is a stochastic domain where duration are sampled from a distribution. \\\n",
    "The state space is : \n",
    "-an array of shape ($nb_{tasks}$, 3), where we store the fact that a task is scheduled, along with start and sampled end times. \\\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Local search domain for RCPSP : \n",
    "An alternative domain implementation for RCPSP is to consider local moves/mutation of the schedules as the available actions for a RL domain. \\\n",
    "In our playground implementation, actions are local moves consisting in reverting a subpart of the permutation of tasks representing the solution. This is similar to the [2-opt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt) mutation for traveling salesman problem.\\\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Direct permutation optimisation :\n",
    "We can also use RL to optimize directly the full permutation, the actions here are a $nb_{tasks}$ floating or integer array. [We use np.argsort to compute a permutation of task that is then used to build an rcpsp solution]\\\n",
