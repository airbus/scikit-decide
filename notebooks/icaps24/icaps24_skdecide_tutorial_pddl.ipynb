For simplicity reasons, we will thus make later on in the problem instance all the floating-point costs rounded to their 3rd digit then scale by 1e3 to make them all integers. Doing so, the problem is now solvable by the `fast-downward-opt` Unified Planning engine. Therefore, we can define the type of the `Cost` fluent to be `IntType`."
