                is solved, or to decide when no labels are used that the value function of the root state
                of the search has converged (in the latter case: the root state's Bellman error is averaged
                over the residual_moving_average_window). Defaults to 0.0.

                no more reachable from the root solving state should be deleted (True) or not (False). Defaults to False.
            custom_policy (Callable[ [T_domain, D.T_agent[D.T_observation]], D.T_agent[D.T_concurrency[D.T_event]], ], optional):
                Custom policy function to use in the rollout policy from non-expanded state nodes when the rollout policy is
                `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.CUSTOM`. Defaults to None (no custom policy in use).
            heuristic (Callable[ [T_domain, D.T_agent[D.T_observation]], Tuple[D.T_agent[Value[D.T_value]], int], ], optional):
                Optional Heuristic function to initialize non-expanded state nodes (returns a pair of value estimate and
                fake number of visit counts). Defaults to None (no heuristic in use).
            state_expansion_rate (float, optional): Value $rs$ used when the expander is `MCTS.Expander.PARTIAL`
                such that the probability of discovering new applicable actions in a given state node with already $na$ discovered
                applicable actions is equal to $e^{-rs \cdot na}$. Defaults to 0.1.

                `MCTS.TransitionMode.SAMPLE` or `MCTS.TransitionMode.DISTRIBUTION` to progress the
                trajectories with, respectively, the 'step' or 'sample' or 'get_next_state_distribution' method of the domain
                depending on the domain's dynamics capabilities). Defaults to `MCTS.TransitionMode.DISTRIBUTION`.
            tree_policy (MCTS.TreePolicy, optional): Tree policy enum (currently only
                `MCTS.TreePolicy.DEFAULT` which rollouts a random trajectory from the current root
                solving state until reaching a non-expanded state node of the tree). Defaults to `MCTS.TreePolicy.DEFAULT`.
            expander (MCTS.Expander, optional): Expander enum used when a state needs to be
                expanded (one of `MCTS.Expander.FULL` if applicable actions and next states should be
                all enumerated for each transition function, or `MCTS.Expander.PARTIAL` if they should
                be sampled with a probability which exponentially decreases as the number of already discovered
                applicable actions and next states increases). Defaults to `MCTS.Expander.FULL`.
            action_selector_optimization (MCTS.ActionSelector, optional): Action selector class used to
                select actions in the tree policy's trajectory simulations (one of
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1` to select the action based on the UCB criterion, or
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.BEST_Q_VALUE` to select the action with maximum Q-Value in the
                current state node). Defaults to `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1`.
            action_selector_execution (MCTS.ActionSelector, optional): Action selector class used to
                select actions at execution time when the 'get_best_action' method of the
                solver is invoked in a given execution state (one of
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1` to select the action based on the UCB criterion, or
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.BEST_Q_VALUE` to select the action with maximum Q-Value in the
                current state node). Defaults to `MCTS.ActionSelector.BEST_Q_VALUE`.
            rollout_policy (MCTS.RolloutPolicy, optional): Rollout policy enum (one of
                `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.RANDOM` to simulate trajectories starting in a non-expanded state
                node of the tree by sampling random applicable actions in each visited state, or
                `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.CUSTOM` to simulate them by applying actions from the given policy
                'custom_policy' given to this constructor, or `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.VOID` to deactivate
                the simulation of trajectories from non-expanded state nodes, in which latter case it is advised to
                provide the 'heuristic' function in this constructor to initialize non-expanded state nodes' values).
                Defaults to `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.RANDOM`.
            back_propagator (MCTS.BackPropagator, optional): Back propagator enum (currently only
                `MCTS.BackPropagator.GRAPH` which back-propagates empirical Q-values from non-expanded
                state nodes up to the root node of the tree along the tree policy's sampled
                trajectories). Defaults to `MCTS.BackPropagator.GRAPH`.
            continuous_planning (bool, optional): Boolean whether the solver should optimize again the policy
                from the current solving state (True) or not (False) even if the policy is already defined
                in this state. Defaults to True.
            parallel (bool, optional): Parallelize MCTS rollouts on different processes using duplicated domains (True)
                or not (False). Defaults to False.
            shared_memory_proxy (_type_, optional): The optional shared memory proxy. Defaults to None.
            callback (Callable[[MCTS, Optional[int]], optional): Function called at the end of each RIW rollout,
                taking as arguments the solver and the thread/process ID (i.e. parallel domain ID, which is equal to None
                in case of sequential execution, i.e. when 'parallel' is set to False in this constructor) from
                which the callback is called, and returning True if the solver must be stopped. The callback lambda
                function cannot take the (potentially parallelized) domain as argument because we could not otherwise
                serialize (i.e. pickle) the solver to pass it to the corresponding parallel domain process in case of parallel
                execution. Nevertheless, the `ParallelSolver.get_domain` method callable on the solver instance
                can be used to retrieve either the user domain in sequential execution, or the parallel domains proxy
                `ParallelDomain` in parallel execution from which domain methods can be called by using the
                callback's process ID argument. Defaults to (lambda slv, i=None: False).
            verbose (bool, optional): Boolean indicating whether verbose messages should be logged (True)
                or not (False). Defaults to False.

            epsilon (float, optional): Maximum Bellman error (residual) allowed to decide that a state
                is solved, or to decide when no labels are used that the value function of the root state
                of the search has converged (in the latter case: the root state's Bellman error is averaged
                over the residual_moving_average_window). Defaults to 0.0.
            discount (float, optional): Value function's discount factor. Defaults to 1.0.

                `MCTS.TransitionMode.SAMPLE` or `MCTS.TransitionMode.DISTRIBUTION` to progress the
                trajectories with, respectively, the 'step' or 'sample' or 'get_next_state_distribution' method of the domain
                depending on the domain's dynamics capabilities). Defaults to `MCTS.TransitionMode.DISTRIBUTION`.
            tree_policy (MCTS.TreePolicy, optional): Tree policy enum (currently only

            expander (MCTS.Expander, optional): Expander enum used when a state needs to be
                expanded (one of `MCTS.Expander.FULL` if applicable actions and next states should be
                all enumerated for each transition function, or `MCTS.Expander.PARTIAL` if they should
                be sampled with a probability which exponentially decreases as the number of already discovered
                applicable actions and next states increases). Defaults to `MCTS.Expander.FULL`.
            action_selector_optimization (MCTS.ActionSelector, optional): Action selector class used to
                select actions in the tree policy's trajectory simulations (one of
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1` to select the action based on the UCB criterion, or
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.BEST_Q_VALUE` to select the action with maximum Q-Value in the
                current state node). Defaults to `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1`.
            action_selector_execution (MCTS.ActionSelector, optional): Action selector class used to
                select actions at execution time when the 'get_best_action' method of the
                solver is invoked in a given execution state (one of
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1` to select the action based on the UCB criterion, or
                `MCTS.ActionSelector.BEST_Q_VALUE` to select the action with maximum Q-Value in the
                current state node). Defaults to `MCTS.ActionSelector.BEST_Q_VALUE`.
            back_propagator (MCTS.BackPropagator, optional): Back propagator enum (currently only
                `MCTS.BackPropagator.GRAPH` which back-propagates empirical Q-values from non-expanded
                state nodes up to the root node of the tree along the tree policy's sampled
                trajectories). Defaults to `MCTS.BackPropagator.GRAPH`.
            continuous_planning (bool, optional): Boolean whether the solver should optimize again the policy
                from the current solving state (True) or not (False) even if the policy is already defined
                in this state. Defaults to True.
            parallel (bool, optional): Parallelize MCTS rollouts on different processes using duplicated domains (True)
                or not (False). Defaults to False.
            shared_memory_proxy (_type_, optional): The optional shared memory proxy. Defaults to None.
            callback (Callable[[HMCTS, Optional[int]], optional): Function called at the end of each MCTS rollout,
                taking as arguments the solver and the thread/process ID (i.e. parallel domain ID, which is equal to None
                in case of sequential execution, i.e. when 'parallel' is set to False in this constructor) from
                which the callback is called, and returning True if the solver must be stopped. The callback lambda
                function cannot take the (potentially parallelized) domain as argument because we could not otherwise
                serialize (i.e. pickle) the solver to pass it to the corresponding parallel domain process in case of parallel
                execution. Nevertheless, the `ParallelSolver.get_domain` method callable on the solver instance
                can be used to retrieve either the user domain in sequential execution, or the parallel domains proxy
                `ParallelDomain` in parallel execution from which domain methods can be called by using the
                callback's process ID argument. Defaults to (lambda slv, i=None: False).
            verbose (bool, optional): Boolean indicating whether verbose messages should be logged (True)
                or not (False). Defaults to False.

            # Parameters
            domain_factory (Callable[[], MCTS.T_domain]): The lambda function to create a domain instance.
            time_budget (int, optional): Maximum solving time in milliseconds. Defaults to 3600000.
            rollout_budget (int, optional): Maximum number of rollouts. Defaults to 100000.
            max_depth (int, optional): Maximum depth of each UCT rollout. Defaults to 1000.
            residual_moving_average_window (int, optional): Number of latest computed residual values
                to memorize in order to compute the average Bellman error (residual) at the root state
                of the search. Defaults to 100.
            epsilon (float, optional): Maximum Bellman error (residual) allowed to decide that a state
                is solved, or to decide when no labels are used that the value function of the root state
                of the search has converged (in the latter case: the root state's Bellman error is averaged
                over the residual_moving_average_window). Defaults to 0.0.
            discount (float, optional): Value function's discount factor. Defaults to 1.0.
            ucb_constant (float, optional): UCB constant as used in the UCT algorithm when the action selector
                (for optimization or execution) is `MCTS.ActionSelector.UCB1`. Defaults to 1.0/sqrt(2.0).
            online_node_garbage (bool, optional): Boolean indicating whether the search graph which is
                no more reachable from the root solving state should be deleted (True) or not (False). Defaults to False.
            custom_policy (Callable[ [MCTS.T_domain, D.T_agent[D.T_observation]], D.T_agent[D.T_concurrency[D.T_event]], ], optional):
                Custom policy function to use in the rollout policy from non-expanded state nodes when the rollout policy is
                `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.CUSTOM`. Defaults to None (no custom policy in use).
            heuristic (Callable[ [MCTS.T_domain, D.T_agent[D.T_observation]], Tuple[D.T_agent[Value[D.T_value]], int], ], optional):
                Optional Heuristic function to initialize non-expanded state nodes (returns a pair of value estimate and
                fake number of visit counts). Defaults to None (no heuristic in use).
            transition_mode (MCTS.TransitionMode, optional): Transition mode enum (one of `MCTS.TransitionMode.STEP`,
                `MCTS.TransitionMode.SAMPLE` or `MCTS.TransitionMode.DISTRIBUTION` to progress the
                trajectories with, respectively, the 'step' or 'sample' or 'get_next_state_distribution' method of the domain
                depending on the domain's dynamics capabilities). Defaults to `MCTS.TransitionMode.DISTRIBUTION`.
            rollout_policy (MCTS.RolloutPolicy, optional): Rollout policy enum (one of
                :`MCTS.RolloutPolicy.RANDOM` to simulate trajectories starting in a non-expanded state
                node of the tree by sampling random applicable actions in each visited state, or
                `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.CUSTOM` to simulate them by applying actions from the given policy
                'custom_policy' given to this constructor, or `MCTS.RolloutPolicy.VOID` to deactivate
                the simulation of trajectories from non-expanded state nodes, in which latter case it is advised to
                provide the 'heuristic' function in this constructor to initialize non-expanded state nodes' values).
                Defaults to :`MCTS.RolloutPolicy.RANDOM`.
            continuous_planning (bool, optional): Boolean whether the solver should optimize again the policy
                from the current solving state (True) or not (False) even if the policy is already defined
                in this state. Defaults to True.
            parallel (bool, optional): Parallelize MCTS rollouts on different processes using duplicated domains (True)
                or not (False). Defaults to False.
            shared_memory_proxy (_type_, optional): The optional shared memory proxy. Defaults to None.
            callback (Callable[[UCT, Optional[int]], optional): Function called at the end of each RIW rollout,
                taking as arguments the solver and the thread/process ID (i.e. parallel domain ID, which is equal to None
                in case of sequential execution, i.e. when 'parallel' is set to False in this constructor) from
                which the callback is called, and returning True if the solver must be stopped. The callback lambda
                function cannot take the (potentially parallelized) domain as argument because we could not otherwise
                serialize (i.e. pickle) the solver to pass it to the corresponding parallel domain process in case of parallel
                execution. Nevertheless, the `ParallelSolver.get_domain` method callable on the solver instance
                can be used to retrieve either the user domain in sequential execution, or the parallel domains proxy
                `ParallelDomain` in parallel execution from which domain methods can be called by using the
                callback's process ID argument. Defaults to (lambda slv, i=None: False).
            verbose (bool, optional): Boolean indicating whether verbose messages should be logged (True)
                or not (False). Defaults to False.
